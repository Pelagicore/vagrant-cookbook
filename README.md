Introduction 
------------
The vagrant cookbook contains a lot of small code snippets that we reuse in
Vagrantfiles provided for different projects. The general guideline is that the
snippets should be generic, and use parameters to create code reuse as far as
possible.

It is worth mentioning that since Pelagicore use Vagrant almost exclusively with 
VirtualBox as the virtualization provider, some scripts assume that Virtualbox
is used as vagrant provider. Most notably when upgrading to debian testing,
virtualbox-dkms is reinstalled and rebuilt for the new kernel.

Directory Structure
-------------------
* build - bash snippets for building software from various source code 
repositories. 
* deps - bash snippets for automatically downloading and installing various 
build/runtime dependencies for common types of work.
* host-system-config - Vagrant snippets and related bash scripts for configuring 
the host systems
* system-config - various scripts for configuring the host system.
utils - utility scripts for various tasks.
* yocto - yocto related utilities used to download tools, setup environments and 
to build yocto targets. 


Example usage: Shell scripts
----------------------------
If you have a snippet of code that looks like this in your current Vagrantfile:

```ruby
config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    ping google.com &> /dev/null &
SHELL
```

It could be broken out into a `vagrant-cookbook/utils/keepalive.sh` script
containing the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ping google.com 6> /dev/null &
```

and then reference that code using:

```ruby
config.vm.provision "shell", path: "cookbook/utils/keepalive.sh"
```

Example usage: Vagrantfile fragments
------------------------------------
Snippets with the `.vagrantfile` suffix are fragments of a Vagrantfile, as
opposed to the shell scripts discussed above. These fragments are typically
executed on the host machine to do things like change VM parameters, etc. These
fragments are included using:

```ruby
eval File.read("path/to/tragment.vagrantfile")
```

Example usage in a project: As a git submodule
----------------------------------------------
In order for your project's Vagrantfile to gain access to the snippets in this
repository, you need to ensure this git is checked out and accessible to your
Vagrantfile. A good way to associate your project with a specific version of
the vagrant-cookbook repository is to use `git submodules` (for more info on
submodules, see here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

Use this git as a submodule in the following way:
```bash
cd your/project/
git submodule add <THIS REPOSITORY> vagrant-cookbook
```

Your Vagrantfile can now refer to the snippets as in the examples above.
