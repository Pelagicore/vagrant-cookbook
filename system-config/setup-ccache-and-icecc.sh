install ccache icecc

#
# According to the ccache and icecc docs, combining these two is best done the following way:
# 1) Make sure ccache is before your compiler in the PATH
# 2) Set CCACHE_PREFIX to icecc. This will make ccache call icecc when there is a cache miss
#
# If you want to use clang, set CC and CXX (since they take precedence). This works together with
# the icecc and ccache setup. However, if you use update-alternatives to select clang, it fails
# for some reason.

# In case one wants to install clang, this will be ready to use with icecc
